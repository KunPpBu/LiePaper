# Introduction
This NLP project focus on the same data set MU3D, which has a column fracture called "Transcription". The Transcription contains the Full transcription of the video, which is a text record of the video for each volunteer. My goal in this NLP part is to calculate the text TF-IDF, which is Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency, to  define the importance of a keyword or phrase within a document. TF- IDF is  the product of two statistics, term frequency and inverse document frequency. where the equations are:

\begin{align*}
TF: \quad   tf(t,d) =  \frac{f_{(t,d)}}{\sum_{{t^{'} \in d}}f_{t^{'}, d}} \\
\newline 
IDF: \quad  idf(t, D) = \log\frac{N}{|\{d \in D: t \in d\}|}\\
\newline
TF-IDF: \quad tfidf(t, d, D) = tf(t,d) \cdot  idf(t, D)
\end{align*}

To interpret the value of TF-IDF, the higher the TF-IDF score the more important or relevant the term is; as a term gets less relevant, its TF-IDF score will approach 0. 

Next, I will import the dataset and calculate the TF-IDF and interpret it step by step. 

# Input Data

```{r import data}
library(dplyr)
library(janeaustenr)
library(tidytext)

data <- read.csv("MU3D_Video_Level_Data.csv")
```

# Data cleaning 
```{r data cleaning}
data$Transcription <- gsub('[[:punct:] ]+',';',data$Transcription)
data$Labels <- ifelse(grepl("T", data$VideoID)=="TRUE", "T", "L")
data2 <- data %>% unnest_tokens(words,Transcription,token = stringr::str_split, pattern = ";") %>%
  select(VideoID, words, Labels)

```

# Calculate TF-IDF
```{r Tf}
cluster_words <- data2 %>%
  count(Labels,words,sort = TRUE)
cluster_total_words <- cluster_words %>%
  group_by(Labels) %>%
  summarize(total=sum(n))
cluster_words <- left_join(cluster_words,cluster_total_words)
cluster_words <- cluster_words %>%
  arrange(Labels)

```

```{r ggplot}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cluster_words, aes(n/total, fill = Labels)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend = FALSE,bins = 2) +
  xlim(NA, 0.01) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,5000))

```


```{r tfidf}
freq_by_rank <- cluster_words %>% 
  group_by(Labels) %>% 
  mutate(rank = row_number(), 
         `term frequency` = n/total) %>%
  ungroup()


freq_by_rank %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rank, `term frequency`, color = Labels)) + 
  geom_line(size = 1.1, alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()

cluster_tf_idf <- cluster_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(words, Labels, n)
cluster_tf_idf
```

# Justisfication 

As the above result shows the words, for example, "and", "I", "you" "to", "a", "the", etc, has a value of zero TF-IDF, which means those words are the least important in the transcription. In the later work, I can remove those words to avoid expensive computational time and increase the accuracy of machine learning classification. 

```{r remove 0 tf-idf}
